# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive sales analysis for Blinkit using Power BI to deliver actionable insights for business decision-making. The analysis involved connecting SQL Server and Excel data sources to Power BI, ensuring seamless data integration.

I designed a star schema data model consisting of fact and dimension tables, which facilitated efficient data organization and retrieval. Using DAX, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and Customer Ratings to provide a clear overview of sales performance.

The interactive dashboard I created featured several components:

Donut Chart: Visualized total sales by fat content, highlighting the distribution of sales among different fat categories.
Bar Chart: Displayed total sales by item type, allowing for a comparative analysis of various product categories.
Line Chart: Showed sales trends based on outlet establishment year, providing insights into growth patterns over time.
Funnel Chart: Illustrated sales by outlet location, identifying geographical performance variations.
Matrix Table: Offered a comprehensive breakdown of KPIs by outlet type, enabling a detailed examination of performance metrics.
Key Insights
The analysis revealed several critical insights, including:

Supermarkets emerged as the highest contributors to sales.
Regular-fat items outperformed low-fat items in terms of revenue generation.
Fruits and snacks were identified as the top-performing product categories.
This dashboard serves as a vital tool for stakeholders at Blinkit to make informed decisions and strategize for future growth.
